So, I have missed a few weeks of blogs! This was mostly because I have forgot or that I haven't been home much, and when I am home, I’m normally sleeping. I will now be back on schedule and continue with the weekly Blogs! I also had my Summer Exams which took a lot of time up as I was revising. So with all of the distractions out of the way (Apart from Gaming and Squash)

I will finally start my blogs up again. This is because we are just learning stuff for Year 8 so it is a bit boring, meaning I'm not doing any extra work!

I might blog over the summer holidays but I will be in Yorkshire, York and maybe even my home country: Australia!
